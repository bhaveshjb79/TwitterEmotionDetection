# TwitterEmotionDetection
With the rapid growth of social networks and microblogging websites, communication between people from different cultural and psychological background.
In this Project, we have presented an experiment that can easily detect categories of emotions like happiness , surprise, neutral, sad, fear and hate on
Twitter platform. Twitter is micro blogging social media site where many
users shares their opinions and discuss about various issues. Many events occurring around the world can be known from this platform, so we can detect
the emotions and find out various issue like fear, depression and hate among
society and can easily get solution to prevent it from happening. 

We have used tweepy, a twitter based API that can get tweets easily from users and hashtags and then we pre-processed those tweets with modern methods of NLPs.
After that, To classify those tweets into different emotions, we have created
CNN-LSTM model that is giving 89.4% accuracy i.e better than traditional
machine learning models.

Previous research on hate speech detection and offensive language has identified this problem but many studies still tend to use the
Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest Decision Tree (RFDT), and
Naive Bayes.

Our approach is based on using combined emotion dataset from dailydialog ,
emotion-stimulus and isear as a test dataset and Twitter as a training dataset
with the method to be used is Long ShortTerm Memory (LSTM) which is the
architecture of the Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to detect hate speech
and offensive language.
